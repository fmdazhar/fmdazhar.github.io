Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Robotics EngineerðŸ¤–**(M.Sc. Robotic Systems Engineering, RWTH Aachen) passionate about blending **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **optimal control** to build intelligent robots capable of agile and meaningful interactions with their environments. 

As an intern in Fraunhofer IPA, I integrated real-time learning pipelines, developed a custom Peg-in-Hole **Mujoco** environment with control modules and teleoperation modules for human-in-the-loop training of **arm manipulator** robot. I also implemented **ROS1/ROS2** frameworks for controlling a real robot with a gripper effectively.

My Master's thesis, conducted jointly with RWTH DSME and RWTH GUT, tackled the challenges **quadruped robots** face when navigating deformable terrains, employing **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for simulation and a reinforcement learning framework to enable resilient and adaptive locomotion strategies.

Previously, at RWTH IRT and RWTH ika, I contributed to classical control systems including **Model Predictive Control** and optimization frameworks, enhancing trajectory planning and autonomous driving technologies. My earlier research at IIITDM involved acoustic-driven microscale fluid dynamics, culminating in multiple high-impact journal publications, before transitioning to robotics.
